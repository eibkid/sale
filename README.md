# Sales Team page



### Aim is to build a django app that enables the sales team to record daily transactions.

* Code was mostly written in python programming language so please take note when trying to run it.
* Each commit indicates some changes I made during the project

* The transaction is submittd to the default SQlite database, which you can view via the admin page.
*  Extraction is the name of the table where the transactions are recorded.
*  the date is automated and drop down options provided for ease.

* After submitting each form , the sales person is directed to a submission status confirmation page and a 'back home' button is a link 
   provided there to redirect to the home page.
